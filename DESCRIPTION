Description: "This R package distributes a dataset of NBA stats covering the years 1950-2017, derived from a dataset on Kaggle available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats/data. The nbastats package has three functions, one dedicated to 1950s player Ed Bartels' true shooting percentage in an inputted year, one that returns the oldest player in the dataset for a given year, and one that produces a correlation matrix of all numeric variables in the dataset for a given year. The packages gives the user a brief glimpse of what fun data practice can be had with the included dataset."
